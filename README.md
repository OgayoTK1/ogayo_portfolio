W3C Validator: Includes a <title> element in the <head> to avoid missing title errors.
Semantic Tags: Uses three semantic tags (<header>, <main>, <footer>) to meet requirements.
Image Attributes: All images have descriptive alt attributes (e.g., "A serene beach with turquoise waves lapping at the shore at sunset") to avoid vague or missing alt issues.
Valid Links: The external link to the World Wildlife Fund is verified and functional.
Accessibility: Passes WAVE checks with no contrast or structural errors.

Broken Image Link: Uses reliable Unsplash URLs for all images, tested for accessibility.
